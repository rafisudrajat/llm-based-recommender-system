# Food classifier and LLM + Hybrid vector search based recommender system

This repository contains a project for my first Hackathon in Rakuten.
In this project I developed 2 main features using AI:

1. Food classifier: using multimodal-mulilanguage LLM, I developed simple application to scan a food ingredients and then check if the food is eligible to eat or not to the user
2. Recommender system based on LLM and hybrid vector search: Given users data and foods data, I built an application that harness the power of LLM and vector search algorithm to give a list of recommended food that user like.

For details about background and technical explanation about this project, please see the [project_explanation.pdf](project_explanation.pdf)
